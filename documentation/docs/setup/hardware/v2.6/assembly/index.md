# SD Card SetUp and Installation


Next, you will need to [set up the PlanktoScope software](../../../software/index.md) on the micro-SD card of your PlanktoScope's Raspberry Pi.

When the software will be uploaded, you can install the SD Card in the PlanktoScope through the window at the bottom of it. Use **small pliers** to help you.
![SD Card Installation 1](images/SD_Card_Installation_1.png "SD Card Installation 1")

# Congratulations!! :tada: :clap: :champagne:

If your arrive to this step it probably means that your PlanktoScope V2.6 is fully assembled!!
What a journey, thank you very much for your commitment.

In order to continue and before starting your first images, the last step is the PlanktoScope set up, ready as it can be to start operating and discovering the beauty of your planktons samples!

To see the set up phase please continue on the next chapter: [PlanktoScope V2.6 SetUp for Operation](.../set up/index.md)
