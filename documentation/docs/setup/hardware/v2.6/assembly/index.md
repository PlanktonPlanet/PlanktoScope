# Assembly of the PlanktoScope V2.6


## Content of the Kit :gear:


<!-- Here the idea is to be able to start with the Planktoscope Kit bought to FairScope or after achieving all the sub assembly metionned in V2.6/kit/Kit Production chapters  -->

It is important to ensure that you have all of the necessary components before beginning the assembly of your PlanktoScope.

You can find the BOM for the PlanktoScope V2.6 and all the informations to supply or manufacture the components named with "… Assembly" in the [Kit Production](.../kit/Kit Production.md) documentation.

## Toolings :hammer_and_wrench:
- PH1 screwdriver


## Step 1: Rubber Feets Assembly

>:hammer_and_wrench:
>_[Tooling](#toolings-hammerandwrench): PH1 screwdriver_

>:gear:
>_[Parts Needed](#content-of-the-kit-gear):_
>	_- 4 x rubber Feets_
>	_- Bamboo Part I_

* Locate the **4 x rubber feet** for the PlanktoScope.

* Place each rubber foot under **Part I** of the PlanktoScope.

* Use the **PH1 screwdriver** to fix each foot in place, ensuring they are firmly attached but not overly tightened.

* Put this assembly on the side.


## Step 2: Position the square nuts

>:hammer_and_wrench:
>_[Tooling](#toolings-hammerandwrench): screwdriver_

>:gear:
>_[Parts Needed](#content-of-the-kit-gear):_
>	_- 32 x square nuts M3x5.5_
>	_- Bamboo Part A, B, C & D_

* Place the **square nut** into a slot using the **screwdriver bit**, then firmly press down on it with the handle of the screwdriver.

* Put this assembly on the side.

## Step 3: Assemble the pump module

>:hammer_and_wrench:
>_[Tooling](#toolings-hammerandwrench): T8H screwdriver_

>:gear:
>_[Parts Needed](#content-of-the-kit-gear):_
>	_- 2 x M2.5x5mm screws_
>	_- Bamboo Part L_
>	_-Persitaltic Pump_


* Place the **Peristaltic Pump** into its designated hole on **Part L**.
![Assemble the pump 1.png](images/Assemble the pump 1.png)
* Flip both parts.
* Use the **T8H screwdriver** to fix each **M2.5x5 screws** in place, ensuring they are firmly attached but not overly tightened.

* Put this assembly on the side.

## Step 4: Assemble the Core Module

>:hammer_and_wrench:
>_[Tooling](#toolings-hammerandwrench):_
>	_-??? screwdriver_
>	_-T6H screwdriver_

>:gear:
>_[Parts Needed](#content-of-the-kit-gear):_
>	_- 4 x Hexagonal Spacer M2X5_
>	_- 4 x Hexagonal Spacer M2X12_
>	_- 4 x Screw TCHC M2X4_
>	_- Bamboo Part A_
>	_- Raspberry Pi 4_
>	_- Hat v1.3 Assy_
>	_- Heat Sink_
> 	_- Camera Ribbon Cable_

* Using a **screwdriver with no bits**, securely fasten each of the **4 x Hexagonal Spacer M2X5** on **Bamboo Part A**, making sure they're tight but not over-tightened.
![Assemble Core Module 1.png](images/Assemble Core Module 1.png "Assemble Core Module 1")

* Position the Raspberry Pi 4 so that it rests on each spacer.
* Using a **screwdriver with no bits**, securely fasten each of the **4 x Hexagonal Spacer M2X12**, making sure they're tight but not over-tightened.
![Assemble Core Module 2.png](images/Assemble Core Module 2.png "Assemble Core Module 2")

  * Remove its protective layer of the **heat sink** and tape it on the Broadcom chip of the **Raspberry Pi**.
![Assemble Core Module 3.png](images/Assemble Core Module 3.png "Assemble Core Module 3")

* Open the black connector is simply a push/pull fit. To disengage the cable, pull the two corners of the black connector down, away from the camera board. It will unclip to about 3mm, make sure you don't pull it off!

>[!WARNING]
>Be careful, this part is delicate. Gently prise the black connector with nail or fingertip and thumb.

* Insert the **Ribbon Cable** you just detached from the Raspberry Pi Camera in the Raspberry Pi. 
* Make sure to insert in as much as you can.
* Secure the Ribbon Cable in the Raspberry Pi by pressing firmly on the black connector.

>[!WARNING]
>Blue rectangle on Ribbon Cable should face the same direction as the arrow below.

* Locate the **PlanktoScope HAT**.
* Thread the Ribbon cable through the PlanktoScope HAT slot from the underside.
![Assemble Core Module 6](images/Assemble Core Module 6.png "Assemble Core Module 6")

* Plug the PlanktoScope HAT into the Raspberry Pi.
* Use the **T6H screwdriver** to fix each of the **4 x Screw TCHC M2X4** in place, ensuring they are firmly attached but not overly tightened.
